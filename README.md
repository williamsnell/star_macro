# STARCCM_Macro
 Macro for setting up STARCCM+ simulations

The macro itself is setup_macro.java. Run this from inside STARCCM.

The macro to do post-processing is post_macro.java.

The python file config_gen.py generates the XML file sim_config. 

boi_0, car, and domain are example cad files to demonstrate proper file and face naming techniques.
